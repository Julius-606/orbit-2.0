{"pending_diagnosis": "<b>DIAGNOSIS:</b> <span class=\"tg-spoiler\">Acute Intermittent Porphyria (AIP)</span>\n\n<b>THE SMOKING GUN:</b> The final clue was pieced together by re-examining the patient's records and conducting a meticulous medication reconciliation. Three weeks prior to admission, Ms. R.T. had started a new, over-the-counter herbal supplement for anxiety, which contained <span class=\"tg-spoiler\">St. John's Wort</span>. Furthermore, she was given <span class=\"tg-spoiler\">Phenobarbital</span> and <span class=\"tg-spoiler\">Haloperidol</span> during her hospital stay\u2014all potent inducers of the hepatic cytochrome P450 system. The key laboratory confirmation, finally received, was drastically elevated urinary Porphobilinogen (PBG) and Delta-Aminolevulinic Acid (ALA).\n\n<b>PATHOPHYSIOLOGY:</b> AIP is an autosomal dominant disorder caused by a deficiency in the enzyme Hydroxymethylbilane Synthase (HMBS), also known as Porphobilinogen Deaminase (PBGD). Under normal circumstances, the deficiency is latent. However, exposure to certain drugs, hormones, or metabolic stress (like low carbohydrate diet, infection) induces hepatic ALA synthase. This induction overloads the heme synthesis pathway, causing the accumulation of the neurotoxic precursors ALA and PBG. These accumulated precursors directly attack the central, peripheral, and autonomic nervous systems, leading to the characteristic \"five P's\":\n1. Psychotic symptoms\n2. Peripheral neuropathy\n3. Pain (Abdominal)\n4. Pressure (Hypertension/Tachycardia)\n5. Purple urine (due to oxidized PBG)."}
