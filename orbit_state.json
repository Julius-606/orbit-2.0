{"pending_diagnosis": "<b>DIAGNOSIS:</b>\n<span class=\"tg-spoiler\">Adult-Onset Urea Cycle Disorder (UCD), specifically Ornithine Transcarbamylase (OTC) Deficiency</span>\n\n<b>THE SMOKING GUN:</b>\nThe combination of rapid, overwhelming <u>Hyperammonemic Encephalopathy</u> in the absence of severe liver failure (normal LFTs, normal INR) and the specific lab triad of <span class=\"tg-spoiler\">Profound Hyperammonemia (>200 \u00b5mol/L), Respiratory Alkalosis (pH >7.5, low pCO2), and Hypoureagenesis (BUN <5 mg/dL)</span>.\n\n<b>PATHOPHYSIOLOGY:</b>\nOTC is a crucial enzyme in the urea cycle, primarily responsible for converting nitrogen waste into urea for excretion by the kidneys. It is the most common UCD. Although often presenting catastrophically in infancy, partial enzyme function due to an X-linked partial mutation allows some patients (particularly males with partial activity, or heterozygous females) to remain asymptomatic until adulthood.\n\nPrecipitating Factors:\n1.  <b>High Protein Load/Catabolism:</b> Stress (like intense PhD work) causes muscle breakdown, dumping nitrogen into the system.\n2.  <b>Medications:</b> Valproate (not used here, but common trigger) or, rarely, increased metabolic load from other medications or supplements.\n3.  <b>Starvation/Fever:</b> Any hypercatabolic state overwhelms the partially functioning OTC enzyme.\n\nThe resulting accumulation of ammonia (NH3), a potent neurotoxin, primarily affects astrocytes, causing massive cerebral edema and the classic symptoms of confusion, psychosis, asterixis, seizures, and ultimately, coma and death if not aggressively managed with nitrogen scavengers (e.g., sodium phenylacetate/benzoate) and emergent hemodialysis. The respiratory alkalosis occurs because ammonia directly stimulates the respiratory center in the brainstem."}
