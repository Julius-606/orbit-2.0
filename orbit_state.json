{"pending_diagnosis": "<b>DIAGNOSIS:</b> <span class=\"tg-spoiler\">Acute Intermittent Porphyria (AIP)</span>\n\n<b>THE SMOKING GUN:</b> The critical history detail\u2014missed during initial triage due to the overwhelming pain presentation\u2014was the recent prescription of <span class=\"tg-spoiler\">a sulfonamide antibiotic (Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole) for her minor URI</span>. This drug is a potent inducer of hepatic cytochrome P450 enzymes. Definitive laboratory confirmation was achieved via significantly elevated levels of urine Porphobilinogen (PBG) and Delta-Aminolevulinic Acid (ALA) from a specialized 24-hour urine collection.\n\n<b>PATHOPHYSIOLOGY:</b> AIP is an autosomal dominant metabolic disorder caused by a partial deficiency in the enzyme Porphobilinogen Deaminase (PBGD), an enzyme critical in the middle of the heme synthesis pathway. This deficiency is usually silent until triggered. During a trigger (e.g., certain drugs, fasting, or acute stress), the initial steps of the pathway are upregulated, causing massive accumulation of the neurotoxic precursors, Porphobilinogen (PBG) and Delta-Aminolevulinic Acid (ALA). ALA is structurally similar to the neurotransmitter GABA, potentially explaining the severe psychiatric manifestations, seizures, and autonomic instability (tachycardia, hypertension, and abdominal pain). The severe <u>hyponatremia</u> is often multifactorial, usually related to hypothalamic involvement causing SIADH (Syndrome of Inappropriate Antidiuretic Hormone secretion) or salt wasting secondary to renal tubular damage from the accumulated porphyrin precursors. Treatment requires immediate cessation of the offending agent and prompt administration of intravenous Hemin (Panhematin), which suppresses the upstream enzymes, preventing further accumulation of the neurotoxins."}
