{"pending_diagnosis": "<b>DIAGNOSIS:</b>\nAcute Hyperammonemia secondary to <span class=\"tg-spoiler\">Ornithine Transcarbamylase (OTC) Deficiency</span>.\n\n<b>THE SMOKING GUN:</b>\nThe presentation of severe, refractory hyperammonemic encephalopathy in an adult with <span class=\"tg-spoiler\">completely normal liver function tests (LFTs) and no preceding liver disease</span> is pathognomonic for a Urea Cycle Disorder (UCD), even if the initial ABG showed no acidosis (often seen in early stages). The specific amino acid profile (high Citrulline, high Argininosuccinic acid, low Arginine) later confirmed the diagnosis as one of the UCDs.\n\n<b>PATHOPHYSIOLOGY:</b>\nOTC Deficiency is the most common Urea Cycle Disorder (UCD), an X-linked metabolic disorder. It involves a defect in the mitochondrial enzyme Ornithine Transcarbamylase, which converts carbamoyl phosphate and ornithine into citrulline. This defect prevents the body from adequately converting neurotoxic ammonia into non-toxic urea for excretion. While often diagnosed in neonates, partial enzyme activity can lead to late-onset presentation, typically triggered by a metabolic stressor (high protein load, viral illness, or specific medications like valproate). The patient's mild symptoms were likely a period of decompensation, rapidly progressing to encephalopathy as ammonia crossed the blood-brain barrier, leading to astrocyte swelling, cerebral edema, and death. Urgent hemodialysis or Continuous Renal Replacement Therapy (CRRT) for direct ammonia removal is the required life-saving intervention, often missed when the focus remains solely on LFTs."}
