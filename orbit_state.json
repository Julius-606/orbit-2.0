{"pending_diagnosis": "<b>DIAGNOSIS:</b>\n<span class=\"tg-spoiler\">Sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (sCJD)</span>\n\n<b>THE SMOKING GUN:</b>\nAfter the initial CSF findings were non-diagnostic for common infections, subsequent testing (requested on Day 7, results returned Day 12) identified the presence of <span class=\"tg-spoiler\">14-3-3 protein and RT-QuIC (Real-Time Quaking-Induced Conversion) was positive for PrPSc</span>.\n\n<b>PATHOPHYSIOLOGY:</b>\nCJD is a uniformly fatal neurodegenerative disorder caused by the accumulation of an abnormally folded prion protein (PrPSc) in the brain. The misfolded protein is highly resistant to standard sterilization and degradation, leading to aggregation and neuronal loss, giving the brain tissue a characteristic spongiform (vacuolated) appearance. Sporadic CJD accounts for 85% of cases and its origin is unknown, often presenting between ages 60-80, though 42 is possible. The classic clinical triad, often seen late in the disease, is: rapidly progressive dementia, myoclonus (usually startle-induced), and characteristic EEG findings (triphasic sharp wave complexes, though generalized slowing was the initial finding here). The rapid progression from non-specific psychiatric symptoms to akinetic mutism within weeks is highly characteristic of this devastating disease."}
