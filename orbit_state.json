{"pending_diagnosis": "<b>DIAGNOSIS:</b>\nThe patient is suffering from an acute attack of <span class=\"tg-spoiler\">Acute Intermittent Porphyria (AIP)</span>. This is a life-threatening, autosomal dominant metabolic disorder resulting from a partial deficiency of the hepatic enzyme Hydroxymethylbilane Synthase (HMBS), formerly known as Porphobilinogen Deaminase (PBGD).\n\n<b>THE SMOKING GUN:</b>\nThe constellation of three findings\u2014acute, non-surgical abdominal pain, neuropsychiatric symptoms, and severe autonomic instability\u2014is classic, but the definitive clue was the measurement of massive elevation in urinary precursors: <span class=\"tg-spoiler\">Markedly elevated Porphobilinogen (PBG) and Delta-Aminolevulinic Acid (ALA) in the urine.</span> The darkening of the urine upon standing is due to the non-enzymatic condensation of PBG to porphobilin.\n\n<b>PATHOPHYSIOLOGY:</b>\nAIP is part of the hepatic porphyrias. The enzyme deficiency is usually latent until precipitated by certain factors (e.g., fasting, stress, infection, or drugs). In Ms. Vance's case, the initial viral illness and, critically, the introduction of the inducing agent, <span class=\"tg-spoiler\">phenobarbital</span> (a known potent inducer of hepatic CYP450 enzymes), triggered the acute attack. The induction of CYP450 increases the demand for heme synthesis. Because the HMBS enzyme is deficient, this increased demand leads to a backlog, resulting in the massive accumulation of neurotoxic precursors (ALA and PBG). These precursors are thought to damage the peripheral, cranial, and autonomic nerves, leading to the neuropathy, paralysis, and severe, unstable hypertension/tachycardia characteristic of a \"porphyric storm.\"\n\nTreatment involves immediate cessation of all inducing drugs, high-dose glucose loading (to suppress ALA synthase), and administration of intravenous <b>heme arginate</b> to inhibit the rate-limiting enzyme ALA synthase."}
