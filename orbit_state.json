{"pending_diagnosis": "<b>DIAGNOSIS:</b> <span class=\"tg-spoiler\">Acute Intermittent Porphyria (AIP)</span>\n\n<b>THE SMOKING GUN:</b> While reviewing the patient\u2019s initial samples for repeat toxicology screening, the resident noted that the urine sample, which was initially light yellow when collected, had turned a deep reddish-brown color after being left exposed to light on the benchtop for several hours. This suggests the presence of excessive porphyrin precursors. <span class=\"tg-spoiler\">Urinary specimen turning dark reddish-brown/purple upon standing and exposure to light.</span>\n\n<b>PATHOPHYSIOLOGY:</b>\nAIP is an autosomal dominant disorder caused by a partial deficiency of the enzyme hydroxymethylbilane synthase (HMBS), previously known as porphobilinogen deaminase (PBGD), the third enzyme in the heme biosynthesis pathway.\nA metabolic trigger (in this case, the highly restrictive ketogenic diet, alcohol, and stress) dramatically increases the demand for heme synthesis. Because of the enzyme deficiency, this leads to the accumulation of toxic precursors: delta-aminolevulinic acid (ALA) and porphobilinogen (PBG).\nALA is believed to be directly neurotoxic, causing the severe abdominal pain (via autonomic neuropathy), psychiatric symptoms (affecting the limbic system), and the motor neuropathy (ascending flaccid paralysis). Hyponatremia is common due to SIADH (syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion), often seen secondary to hypothalamic involvement or massive fluid loss from vomiting. Prompt treatment involves high-dose glucose infusion and intravenous human hemin."}
