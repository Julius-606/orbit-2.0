The crisis was precipitated by the recent initiation of the cytochrome P450-inducing anti-epileptic medication.</span>\n\n<b>PATHOPHYSIOLOGY:</b>\nAIP is an autosomal dominant disorder caused by a deficiency in the enzyme Hydroxymethylbilane Synthase (also known as PBG deaminase). This deficiency is usually asymptomatic until triggered by factors like certain drugs (CYP450 inducers, sulfonamides), alcohol, fasting, or severe physiological stress. When triggered, the demand for heme synthesis increases, overwhelming the deficient enzyme. This leads to the massive accumulation of the neurotoxic precursors ALA and PBG, which cross the blood-brain barrier and cause damage to the central, peripheral, and autonomic nervous systems, manifesting as the characteristic triad of abdominal pain, psychiatric disturbance, and neuropathy/paralysis. The <u>hyponatremia</u> seen early in the presentation is often due to SIADH, a common autonomic manifestation of the disease. Immediate treatment involves high-dose intravenous dextrose (to suppress ALA synthase) and intravenous Hemin."}
