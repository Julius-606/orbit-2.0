{"pending_diagnosis": "<b>DIAGNOSIS:</b> <span class=\"tg-spoiler\">Acute Intermittent Porphyria (AIP) Crisis</span>\n\n<b>THE SMOKING GUN:</b> <span class=\"tg-spoiler\">Five days prior to admission, Ms. L.M. started a new highly restrictive, calorie-deficient diet combined with an over-the-counter supplement containing phenobarbital to aid sleep and anxiety related to her work stress.</span>\n\n<b>PATHOPHYSIOLOGY:</b> AIP is an autosomal dominant disorder resulting from a partial deficiency of the enzyme Porphobilinogen Deaminase (PBGD) in the heme synthesis pathway. While typically asymptomatic, crises are triggered by factors that increase the demand for heme synthesis or induce the rate-limiting enzyme, delta-aminolevulinate synthase (ALAS-1). Key triggers include calorie restriction (fasting), stress, hormonal changes, and especially certain cytochrome P450-inducing drugs (e.g., barbiturates, sulfonamides). The combination of fasting (a nutritional trigger) and phenobarbital (a potent drug trigger) dramatically induced ALAS-1. This causes a massive accumulation of the neurotoxic precursors Delta-Aminolevulinic Acid (ALA) and Porphobilinogen (PBG). These molecules are highly toxic to the nervous system, particularly the autonomic and peripheral nerves, causing the excruciating abdominal pain (visceral neuropathy), severe tachycardia/hypertension (autonomic instability), and the rapidly ascending paralysis (motor neuropathy). The psychosis and delirium are due to central nervous system toxicity. Diagnosis is confirmed by demonstrating severely elevated levels of ALA and PBG in a random urine sample, which, notably, may darken upon standing due to oxidation of PBG."}
