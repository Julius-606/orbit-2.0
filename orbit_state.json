{"pending_diagnosis": "<b>DIAGNOSIS:</b> <span class=\"tg-spoiler\">Acute Intermittent Porphyria (AIP)</span>\n\n<b>THE SMOKING GUN:</b> The critical history detail\u2014missed on initial intake\u2014was that the patient had recently started taking <span class=\"tg-spoiler\">a new sulfa-based antibiotic (sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim) for a presumed sinus infection 5 days prior to admission. The laboratory confirmed greatly elevated urine Porphobilinogen (PBG) and Delta-Aminolevulinic Acid (ALA).</span>\n\n<b>PATHOPHYSIOLOGY:</b> AIP is an autosomal dominant disorder caused by a deficiency in the enzyme Porphobilinogen Deaminase (PBGD), the third enzyme in the heme biosynthesis pathway. This partial deficiency is usually asymptomatic until triggered by stressors, such as certain drugs (barbiturates, alcohol, sulfonamides), fasting, or hormonal changes. The enzyme deficiency leads to the massive accumulation of neurotoxic intermediates, ALA and PBG. These precursors directly damage the central and peripheral nervous systems, causing the characteristic acute neuropathy, autonomic instability (leading to severe tachycardia and hypertension), visceral pain (due to autonomic neuropathy of the gut), and acute psychiatric disturbances/seizures. Immediate treatment involves cessation of the offending agent and administration of intravenous Hemin to suppress ALA synthase activity and thus reduce the production of the toxic intermediates."}
