{"pending_diagnosis": "<b>DIAGNOSIS:</b>\n<span class=\"tg-spoiler\">Acute Intermittent Porphyria (AIP)</span>\n\n<b>THE SMOKING GUN:</b>\n<span class=\"tg-spoiler\">Profound elevation of Porphobilinogen (PBG) and Delta-Aminolevulinic Acid (ALA) in the urine, confirmed by the spontaneous darkening of the stored urine sample, which is characteristic of the oxidation of PBG.</span>\n\n<b>PATHOPHYSIOLOGY:</b>\nAcute Intermittent Porphyria is a rare, autosomal dominant metabolic disorder caused by a deficiency in the enzyme hydroxymethylbilane synthase (also called porphobilinogen deaminase or PBGD). This enzyme is crucial in the pathway of heme synthesis. The defect leads to the buildup of neurotoxic precursors, specifically ALA and PBG, in the liver. Attacks are often triggered by enzyme-inducing drugs (like the OCP or certain anticonvulsants), high physiological stress, or significant caloric restriction (her restrictive diet). The symptoms\u2014severe abdominal pain (due to autonomic neuropathy), hyponatremia (often secondary to CNS involvement and inappropriate ADH secretion), and rapid, profound polyneuropathy\u2014form a classic, if rare, triad that, when missed, can lead to fatality via respiratory paralysis. Treatment involves high-dose intravenous glucose and, crucially, intravenous hemin to repress the rate-limiting enzyme ALA synthase, thereby reducing the production of the toxic precursors."}
