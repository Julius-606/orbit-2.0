{"pending_diagnosis": "<b>DIAGNOSIS:</b> <span class=\"tg-spoiler\">Acute Intermittent Porphyria (AIP)</span>\n\n<b>THE SMOKING GUN:</b> <span class=\"tg-spoiler\">The triad of non-surgical, refractory abdominal pain, acute psychosis, and rapidly ascending motor neuropathy, coupled with unexplained hyponatremia and \"tea-colored\" urine that darkens upon exposure to light/air (due to polymerization of porphobilinogen (PBG)). The triggering factor was likely the herbal supplement, which often contains enzyme-inducing alkaloids.</span>\n\n<b>PATHOPHYSIOLOGY:</b> AIP is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by a partial deficiency of the enzyme Hydroxymethylbilane Synthase (HMBS), the third enzyme in the heme synthesis pathway. This deficiency is usually asymptomatic until the patient is exposed to a precipitating factor (e.g., certain drugs, alcohol, fasting, severe stress, or hormonal changes). The trigger induces a massive upregulation of the first enzyme in the pathway, delta-aminolevulinate synthase (ALAS1). Because HMBS is deficient, this leads to a toxic accumulation of heme precursors, specifically delta-aminolevulinic acid (ALA) and porphobilinogen (PBG). ALA is structurally similar to GABA and acts as a potent neurotoxin, directly causing the neuropsychiatric symptoms, seizures, and peripheral neuropathy. The autonomic dysfunction (hypertension, tachycardia, severe pain) results from the effect of ALA/PBG accumulation on the autonomic nervous system. Hyponatremia often occurs due to Syndrome of Inappropriate Antidiuretic Hormone Secretion (SIADH), which exacerbates the neurological symptoms. Treatment requires urgent administration of intravenous hemin to repress hepatic ALAS1."}
