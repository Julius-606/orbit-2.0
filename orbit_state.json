{"pending_diagnosis": "<b>DIAGNOSIS:</b> <span class=\"tg-spoiler\">Acute Intermittent Porphyria (AIP) Crisis</span>\n\n<b>THE SMOKING GUN:</b> <span class=\"tg-spoiler\">A highly elevated measurement of Urine Porphobilinogen (PBG) and Aminolevulinic Acid (ALA), confirmed by a positive Watson-Schwartz test (or modern liquid chromatography). The triggering agent was later identified as a barbiturate derivative taken for pain, a known potent inducer of the crisis.</span>\n\n<b>PATHOPHYSIOLOGY:</b>\nAcute Intermittent Porphyria is an autosomal dominant disorder caused by a deficiency in the enzyme Hydroxymethylbilane Synthase (HMBS), also known as Porphobilinogen Deaminase. This deficiency impairs the synthesis pathway of heme. While the deficiency is present throughout life, symptoms only manifest during an acute crisis, often triggered by exogenous factors such as fasting, infection, stress, or\u2014most commonly\u2014drugs (especially barbiturates, sulfa drugs, or alcohol) that induce hepatic CYP450 enzymes. The induction of these enzymes consumes available heme, further depleting the already low supply and increasing the demands on the deficient HMBS pathway. This results in the massive overaccumulation of the neurotoxic precursors, Porphobilinogen (PBG) and Aminolevulinic Acid (ALA). ALA is structurally similar to the neurotransmitter GABA and is thought to be the primary cause of the severe neuro-visceral symptoms, including the confusing abdominal pain (due to autonomic neuropathy), seizures, psychosis, and the severe ascending motor paralysis, often mimicking Guillain-Barr\u00e9 Syndrome (GBS). The hyponatremia is secondary to inappropriate ADH secretion (SIADH) resulting from CNS involvement."}
