{"pending_diagnosis": "<b>DIAGNOSIS:</b> <span class=\"tg-spoiler\">Acute Intermittent Porphyria (AIP)</span>\n\n<b>THE SMOKING GUN:</b> On deeper review of her recent history (obtained from her partner), she reported starting a new herbal supplement for \"stress relief\" three weeks ago. Further forensic testing of the supplement's ingredients revealed it contained significant quantities of <span class=\"tg-spoiler\">St. John's Wort, a potent inducer of hepatic CYP450 enzymes.</span> This induction, combined with physiological stress, precipitated the acute attack.\n\n<b>PATHOPHYSIOLOGY:</b>\nAIP is an autosomal dominant disorder caused by a deficiency in hydroxymethylbilane synthase (HMBS), leading to the accumulation of neurotoxic porphyrin precursors: delta-aminolevulinic acid (ALA) and porphobilinogen (PBG). These precursors are highly soluble and cross the blood-brain barrier.\nThe clinical syndrome is characterized by the \"3 Ps\": Pain (severe abdominal), Psychosis, and Polyneuropathy (often motor-dominant, ascending).\nThe severe hypertension and tachycardia reflect sympathetic overdrive due to autonomic neuropathy.\nThe profound hyponatremia (Na 117 mEq/L) is classic and typically results from Syndrome of Inappropriate Antidiuretic Hormone Secretion (SIADH), which PBG is thought to trigger centrally.\nTreatment involves high-dose dextrose (to suppress heme synthesis) and IV administration of hemin (heme arginate) to repress the upstream enzyme (ALA synthase)."}
