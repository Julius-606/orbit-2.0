{"pending_diagnosis": "<b>DIAGNOSIS:</b> <span class=\"tg-spoiler\">X-linked Adrenoleukodystrophy (Cerebral ALD)</span>\n\n<b>THE SMOKING GUN:</b> The co-occurrence of rapidly progressive, posterior-predominant demyelinating <span class=\"tg-spoiler\">leukoencephalopathy (as identified by the characteristic parieto-occipital MRI pattern) and confirmed primary adrenal insufficiency (Addison\u2019s Disease)</span> in a young male is pathognomonic until biochemical testing proves otherwise.\n\n<b>PATHOPHYSIOLOGY:</b>\nAdrenoleukodystrophy (ALD) is an X-linked peroxisomal disorder caused by a mutation in the ABCD1 gene. This gene codes for a peroxisomal membrane protein responsible for the transport of very long-chain fatty acids (VLCFAs) into the peroxisome for degradation via beta-oxidation. When this transport mechanism fails, VLCFAs (specifically those 24 carbons or longer) accumulate in the plasma, cerebral white matter, and adrenal cortex. In the cerebral form (as seen here, often presenting rapidly in childhood or early adulthood), this accumulation triggers a severe inflammatory and autoimmune-like demyelination, often starting in the posterior brain regions (parieto-occipital lobes), resulting in the characteristic MRI finding and catastrophic vision loss. The adrenal toxicity leads to corticosteroid deficiency (Addison's disease), explaining the patient's refractory hyponatremia and hypotension. The definitive diagnosis relies on quantifying plasma VLCFAs, which will show elevated C24:0 and C26:0 levels, and an increased C24/C22 and C26/C22 ratio."}
