{"pending_diagnosis": "<b>DIAGNOSIS:</b> <span class=\"tg-spoiler\">Acute Intermittent Porphyria (AIP)</span>\n\n<b>THE SMOKING GUN:</b> The laboratory technician, processing a sample obtained on Day 2, noticed that a urine specimen collected from the patient had turned a dark, port-wine color after being left exposed to sunlight on the counter. Immediate testing confirmed dramatically elevated levels of Porphobilinogen (PBG) and Delta-Aminolevulinic Acid (ALA). <span class=\"tg-spoiler\">Dramatically elevated urine Porphobilinogen (PBG) during an acute attack</span>\n\n<b>PATHOPHYSIOLOGY:</b>\nAIP is an autosomal dominant metabolic disorder caused by a deficiency in the enzyme Hydroxymethylbilane Synthase (HMBS), also known as Porphobilinogen Deaminase (PBGD). This deficiency impairs the heme synthesis pathway. An acute \"attack\" is often triggered by exogenous factors (like the patient's new over-the-counter pain medications, which were P450-inducers, or severe caloric restriction, stress, or hormones). The trigger leads to the accumulation of the neurotoxic heme precursors, specifically ALA and PBG, which directly damage the peripheral, autonomic, and central nervous systems, leading to the characteristic triad of abdominal pain, neurological/psychiatric symptoms, and autonomic instability (tachycardia, hypertension, and often SIADH-like hyponatremia due to central involvement). Treatment involves high-dose glucose loading and IV Heme Arginate to suppress hepatic ALA synthase activity."}
