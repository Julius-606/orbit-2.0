{"pending_diagnosis": "<b>DIAGNOSIS:</b> <span class=\"tg-spoiler\">Acute Intermittent Porphyria (AIP)</span>\n\n<b>THE SMOKING GUN:</b> The combination of acute, disproportionately severe abdominal pain, psychiatric disturbance (psychosis), autonomic instability (tachycardia, hypertension, SIADH leading to hyponatremia), and a rapidly ascending axonal neuropathy, following the exposure to <span class=\"tg-spoiler\">a known enzymatic inhibitor (sulfa drug)</span>. A late, but characteristic, finding that was subsequently confirmed was that the patient\u2019s urine, initially collected on Day 1, had darkened significantly to a port-wine color upon standing and exposure to light.\n\n<b>PATHOPHYSIOLOGY:</b>\nAcute Intermittent Porphyria is an autosomal dominant disorder caused by a partial deficiency of Hydroxymethylbilane Synthase (HMBS), the third enzyme in the heme biosynthesis pathway. Normally, this deficiency is asymptomatic (latent). However, exposure to specific triggers (drugs like sulfonamides, phenobarbital, alcohol, starvation, or hormonal changes) significantly increases the activity of the rate-limiting enzyme, ALA Synthase. This overwhelms the deficient HMBS, leading to the massive accumulation of neurotoxic heme precursors: Delta-aminolevulinic acid (ALA) and Porphobilinogen (PBG). These precursors are toxic to the peripheral, central, and autonomic nervous systems, causing the characteristic triad of abdominal pain, psychiatric symptoms, and neuropathy. Treatment involves avoiding triggers and administering IV Hemin to repress ALA Synthase activity."}
