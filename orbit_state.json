{"pending_diagnosis": "<b>DIAGNOSIS:</b> Acute Fulminant <span class=\"tg-spoiler\">Shoshin Beriberi (Wet Beriberi)</span>\n\n<b>THE SMOKING GUN:</b> The rapid onset of profound, high-output <span class=\"tg-spoiler\">cardiac failure and refractory, massive lactic acidosis in the context of recent severe dietary restriction</span>. Immediate, dramatic clinical improvement following empirical high-dose intravenous Thiamine administration confirmed the diagnosis (Thiamine levels later returned critically low).\n\n<b>PATHOPHYSIOLOGY:</b>\n\nShoshin Beriberi is the cardiovascular form of severe Thiamine (Vitamin B1) deficiency. Thiamine Pyrophosphate (TPP) is an indispensable cofactor for several key enzymes in energy metabolism, most critically Pyruvate Dehydrogenase (PDH).\n\nIn a severe TPP deficit, PDH activity halts, preventing pyruvate from being converted to acetyl-CoA and entering the Krebs cycle. Instead, pyruvate is diverted into the anaerobic pathway, resulting in a massive buildup of lactate. This overwhelming deficiency causes profound tissue starvation and cellular death, manifesting as lactic acidosis far exceeding typical circulatory causes. Furthermore, Thiamine deficiency impairs vascular tone regulation, leading to catastrophic peripheral vasodilation and high-output cardiac failure, causing the distributive shock component observed. Treatment with high-dose IV Thiamine (100 mg) is life-saving and often yields improvement within hours."}
