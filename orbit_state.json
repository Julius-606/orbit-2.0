{"pending_diagnosis": "<b>DIAGNOSIS:</b>\n<span class=\"tg-spoiler\">Acute Intermittent Porphyria (AIP)</span>\n\n<b>THE SMOKING GUN:</b>\nThe ultimate confirmation was achieved via specialized urine studies, showing massive elevation of <span class=\"tg-spoiler\">porphobilinogen (PBG) and delta-aminolevulinic acid (ALA)</span>. The attending physician noted, retrospectively, that the patient's urine specimen, after standing exposed to light for several hours, had darkened to a distinctive reddish-brown color.\n\n<b>PATHOPHYSIOLOGY:</b>\nAIP is an autosomal dominant disorder caused by a deficiency in the enzyme hydroxymethylbilane synthase (also called porphobilinogen deaminase or PBG-D). This deficiency impairs the production of heme, leading to the accumulation of neurotoxic porphyrin precursors, specifically ALA and PBG, in the liver and nervous system. The accumulation causes damage to the peripheral, autonomic, and central nervous systems.\n\nThe characteristic findings\u2014the \"Five Ps\"\u2014are crucial for diagnosis:\n1. Pain (severe abdominal)\n2. Polyneuropathy (ascending paralysis/paresthesia)\n3. Psychiatric symptoms (anxiety, psychosis)\n4. Pink urine (or dark upon standing)\n5. Precipitation by drugs (such as the diazepam administered early in the course, barbiturates, or sulfa drugs, which induce the liver enzyme ALAS1, overwhelming the deficient PBG-D enzyme).\n\nThe severe hypertension and tachycardia seen in this case are hallmarks of autonomic neuropathy, and the hyponatremia is often due to SIADH triggered by hypothalamic involvement. Prompt treatment involves high-dose dextrose to suppress ALAS1 synthesis, followed by intravenous hemin (Panhematin) to replete the deficient heme."}
