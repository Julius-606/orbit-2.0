{"pending_diagnosis": "<b>DIAGNOSIS:</b>\n<span class=\"tg-spoiler\">Acute Intermittent Porphyria (AIP)</span>\n\n<b>THE SMOKING GUN:</b>\nThe treating physician discovered that the patient had been prescribed an anti-epileptic medication\u2014specifically, <span class=\"tg-spoiler\">Phenobarbital</span>\u2014three weeks prior for mild tremor, and had recently intensified her low-carb diet, inducing a state of relative <span class=\"tg-spoiler\">calorie deprivation/fasting</span>. Both of these are potent inducers of the disease cascade.\n\n<b>PATHOPHYSIOLOGY:</b>\nAcute Intermittent Porphyria is an autosomal dominant disorder caused by a deficiency in the enzyme Porphobilinogen Deaminase (PBGD), the third enzyme in the hepatic heme synthesis pathway. While the enzyme deficiency is genetic, symptoms only manifest when the pathway is stressed (induced) by environmental triggers (e.g., fasting, certain drugs, high stress, infection).\n\nInduction leads to the massive accumulation of neurotoxic heme precursors, specifically Porphobilinogen (PBG) and Aminolevulinic Acid (ALA). ALA is structurally similar to GABA and acts as a potent neurotoxin, primarily affecting the autonomic, central, and peripheral nervous systems.\n\nThe 'Five P's' of presentation were all met:\n1. Pain (Abdominal)\n2. Polyneuropathy (Ascending weakness)\n3. Psychosis (Hallucinations, confusion)\n4. Pink/Port Wine Urine (Due to accumulated Porphobilinogens)\n5. Precipitated by Drugs (Phenobarbital) and Diet (Fasting)\n\nTreatment involves immediate removal of the precipitating factors and administration of high-dose glucose and intravenous Heme (Hemin) to suppress the hepatic production of ALA and PBG via negative feedback."}
