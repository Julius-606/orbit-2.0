{"pending_diagnosis": "<b>DIAGNOSIS:</b> <span class=\"tg-spoiler\">Acute Intermittent Porphyria (AIP)</span>\n\n<b>THE SMOKING GUN:</b> Further detailed history, obtained retrospectively from the primary care records after the crisis developed, revealed that the short course of medication she started for her URI was <span class=\"tg-spoiler\">Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (Bactrim)</span>, a known potent inducer of hepatic delta-aminolevulinate synthase (ALA synthase). Qualitative urine screening confirmed extremely high levels of Porphobilinogen (PBG).\n\n<b>PATHOPHYSIOLOGY:</b> AIP is an autosomal dominant disorder caused by a deficiency in the enzyme Hydroxymethylbilane Synthase (HMBS), also known as Porphobilinogen Deaminase. This deficiency alone is usually asymptomatic. However, when the heme synthesis pathway is induced (e.g., by stress, fasting, alcohol, or, crucially, P450-inducing drugs like sulfonamides, barbiturates, or certain anticonvulsants), the defective pathway is overwhelmed. This leads to a massive accumulation of the neurotoxic precursors Delta-Aminolevulinic Acid (ALA) and Porphobilinogen (PBG).\n\nALA is highly neurotoxic, causing:\n1. Visceral Neuropathy (severe, non-surgical abdominal pain).\n2. Peripheral Neuropathy (ascending flaccid quadriplegia).\n3. Central and Autonomic Toxicity (psychosis, seizures, severe hypertension, and tachycardia).\nThe hyponatremia is often due to SIADH\u2014a direct effect of the neurotoxicity on the hypothalamus/pituitary axis. Treatment involves withdrawing the inducing drug and administering IV Heme (Hemin) to suppress the induction of ALA synthase, thereby starving the toxic pathway."}
