{"pending_diagnosis": "<b>DIAGNOSIS:</b> <span class=\"tg-spoiler\">Late-Onset Ornithine Transcarbamylase (OTC) Deficiency</span>\n\n<b>THE SMOKING GUN:</b> <span class=\"tg-spoiler\">Severe, profound hyperammonemia (510 \u00b5mol/L) coexisting with a critically low Blood Urea Nitrogen (BUN) level (5 mg/dL), signifying a catastrophic breakdown of the Urea Cycle, the body's primary ammonia detoxification system. The acute presentation was triggered by the massive nitrogen load from the high-protein meal.</span>\n\n<b>PATHOPHYSIOLOGY:</b> OTC Deficiency is the most common inherited Urea Cycle Disorder (UCD), an X-linked metabolic condition. The OTC enzyme is essential for converting carbamoyl phosphate and ornithine into citrulline within the mitochondria of hepatocytes. When the enzyme is functionally deficient (even in late-onset cases which have some residual function), excess nitrogen cannot be incorporated into urea for safe excretion. Instead, it accumulates as ammonia. Ammonia is highly neurotoxic, readily crosses the blood-brain barrier, leading to rapid cerebral edema and subsequent fatal herniation if not immediately controlled. The acutely high LFTs are often secondary damage resulting from the severe metabolic stress and liver dysfunction, not the primary cause of the neurological crisis. The diagnostic key is recognizing the inability to produce urea (low BUN) while nitrogen breakdown products (ammonia) are peaking\u2014a classic failure of the hepatic urea synthesis pathway."}
