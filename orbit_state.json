{"pending_diagnosis": "<b>DIAGNOSIS:</b> <span class=\"tg-spoiler\">Acute Intermittent Porphyria (AIP)</span>\n\n<b>THE SMOKING GUN:</b> The constellation of symptoms\u2014abdominal pain (the \"belly cries\") without inflammation, acute neuropathy (often motor dominant), severe autonomic instability, central neuro-psychiatric involvement (seizures, confusion), profound hyponatremia (often SIADH-related), and the critical observation of <span class=\"tg-spoiler\">urine darkening upon exposure to light and air</span> (due to oxidation of accumulated porphobilinogen). Investigation revealed the patient had started a <span class=\"tg-spoiler\">new sulfa-containing antibiotic for a minor skin infection 10 days prior</span>, a known precipitant.\n\n<b>PATHOPHYSIOLOGY:</b> Acute Intermittent Porphyria is an autosomal dominant disorder caused by a partial deficiency of the enzyme Porphobilinogen Deaminase (PBGD), also known as Hydroxymethylbilane Synthase (HMBS). This deficiency, when triggered by metabolic stress (fasting, infection, or specific drugs like sulfa drugs, barbiturates, alcohol, or hormones), leads to a buildup of highly neurotoxic precursors: delta-aminolevulinic acid (ALA) and porphobilinogen (PBG). These precursors are toxic to both the peripheral and central nervous systems, causing the sensory-motor neuropathy, acute encephalopathy, and extreme autonomic dysfunction that mimics a host of common conditions. Treatment involves high-dose glucose infusion and intravenous heme administration (e.g., Hemin or Givosiran)."}
