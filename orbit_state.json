{"pending_diagnosis": "<b>DIAGNOSIS:</b>\n<span class=\"tg-spoiler\">Adult-Onset Ornithine Transcarbamylase (OTC) Deficiency</span>\n\n<b>THE SMOKING GUN:</b>\n<span class=\"tg-spoiler\">Plasma Ammonia Level (Measured retrospectively at 980 \u00b5mol/L; Normal range < 35 \u00b5mol/L)</span>\n\n<b>PATHOPHYSIOLOGY:</b>\n\nOTC Deficiency is the most common inherited urea cycle disorder (UCD). This X-linked disorder results in the inability to adequately metabolize nitrogenous waste (ammonia) into urea. While severe presentations occur in neonates, attenuated, milder mutations often lead to late-onset presentation, typically triggered by physiological stress (high protein intake, catabolism, or infection).\n\nIn Ms. V.H., a minor catabolic state likely overloaded her partially functional OTC enzyme, leading to severe hyperammonemia.\n\nThe key clinical triad was:\n1.  Acute, profound encephalopathy mimicking psychosis/encephalitis.\n2.  Profound respiratory alkalosis (Hyperammonemia directly stimulates the medullary respiratory centers, driving hyperventilation and blowing off CO2).\n3.  Neurological signs (Hyperreflexia, clonus, and impending cerebral edema are classic signs of neurotoxicity from high ammonia levels).\n\nTreatment involves immediate cessation of protein intake, aggressive ammonia scavenging (e.g., sodium phenylacetate, sodium benzoate), and often emergent hemodialysis to rapidly reduce ammonia levels before irreversible cerebral edema and brain death occur."}
