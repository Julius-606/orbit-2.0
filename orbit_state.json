{"pending_diagnosis": "<b>DIAGNOSIS:</b>\n<span class=\"tg-spoiler\">Fatal Familial Insomnia (FFI)</span>\n\n<b>THE SMOKING GUN:</b>\nThe key clue, confirmed via sequencing of the peripheral blood mononuclear cells, was the identification of the <span class=\"tg-spoiler\">D178N point mutation on the PRNP (prion protein) gene, coupled with methionine homozygosity at codon 129</span>. This genetic profile is pathognomonic for the inherited form of this rare transmissible spongiform encephalopathy. A focused family history review revealed several elderly relatives who had died rapidly following a syndrome of psychiatric disturbance and gait instability, previously misdiagnosed as rapid-onset dementia or encephalitis.\n\n<b>PATHOPHYSIOLOGY:</b>\nFatal Familial Insomnia is one of the human prion diseases. It is caused by the misfolding of the normal prion protein (PrP<sup-c</sup>) into an abnormal, pathogenic conformation (PrP<sup-sc</sup>). This misfolded protein is resistant to degradation and accumulates, acting as a template to convert more normal proteins into the misfolded form.\n\nIn FFI, the abnormal PrP<sup-sc</sup> aggregates specifically target and destroy neurons primarily in the thalamus, particularly the ventral medial and anterior thalamic nuclei. These nuclei are critical regulators of the sleep-wake cycle and autonomic stability. The selective destruction of these central regulatory centers results in the hallmark clinical triad observed in this patient:\n1. Intractable, untreatable insomnia (agrypnia).\n2. Severe dysautonomia (tachycardia, hyperhidrosis, hyperthermia).\n3. Rapidly progressive motor signs (ataxia and pyramidal signs) and dementia."}
