{"pending_diagnosis": "<b>DIAGNOSIS:</b> <span class=\"tg-spoiler\">Acute Intermittent Porphyria (AIP)</span>\n\n<b>THE SMOKING GUN:</b>\nOn Day 4, the nursing staff documented that a fresh sample of the patient\u2019s urine, left on the lab bench awaiting specialized testing, had dramatically darkened from a pale yellow to a deep <span class=\"tg-spoiler\">'port-wine' red/brown color upon exposure to light and air</span>. This prompted specific metabolic testing.\n\n<b>PATHOPHYSIOLOGY:</b>\nAcute Intermittent Porphyria is an autosomal dominant disorder caused by a deficiency in the enzyme Hydroxymethylbilane Synthase (HMBS), the third enzyme in the heme synthesis pathway. This deficiency leads to the accumulation of neurotoxic porphyrin precursors, specifically Porphobilinogen (PBG) and Delta-Aminolevulinic Acid (ALA).\nThe acute attack (often precipitated by stressors like low-calorie diets, certain drugs, or stress) manifests primarily as severe autonomic neuropathy (causing the abdominal pain, hypertension, and tachycardia), peripheral neuropathy (leading to paralysis), and central nervous system toxicity (resulting in seizures, psychosis, and SIADH-mediated hyponatremia). Diagnosis is confirmed by massively elevated urinary PBG and ALA during the acute phase. Treatment involves intravenous administration of Panhematin (Heme arginate) to suppress ALA synthase and halt precursor production, alongside glucose loading."}
