{"pending_diagnosis": "<b>DIAGNOSIS:</b> <span class=\"tg-spoiler\">Acute Intermittent Porphyria (AIP)</span>\n\n<b>THE SMOKING GUN:</b> <span class=\"tg-spoiler\">The patient's initial symptoms began shortly after being prescribed a sulfa antibiotic (a known precipitating factor), and subsequent urine samples collected during the crisis, when left exposed to ambient light, oxidized and darkened to a distinct, reddish-brown (port-wine) color.</span>\n\n<b>PATHOPHYSIOLOGY:</b>\nAIP is an autosomal dominant metabolic disorder caused by a partial deficiency of the enzyme Hydroxymethylbilane Synthase (HMBS), formerly known as Porphobilinogen Deaminase (PBGD). This enzyme is crucial in the heme biosynthesis pathway. The partial deficiency is typically asymptomatic until triggered by factors that induce hepatic production of ALA synthase (ALAS1), the rate-limiting enzyme in heme production (e.g., specific medications like barbiturates, sulfonamides, or fasting/stress). The induced pathway overwhelms the deficient HMBS, leading to the rapid accumulation of neurotoxic precursors, specifically Delta-aminolevulinic acid (ALA) and Porphobilinogen (PBG). These high levels of ALA/PBG cause widespread autonomic and peripheral nervous system damage, presenting as the classic triad of psychiatric symptoms, severe abdominal pain (due to autonomic neuropathy of the gut), and peripheral/motor neuropathy. Severe hyponatremia is common, often mediated by SIADH or salt wasting secondary to renal tubular damage. Treatment involves immediate withdrawal of precipitating factors and administration of intravenous heme (Hemin/Panhematin) to downregulate ALAS1."}
